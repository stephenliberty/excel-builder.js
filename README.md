Contributing
-------------

Originally this project was sort of sponsored by a previous company I worked for. Unfortunately now it has no backing, and my time is very limited while I work on side projects to help make ends meet. If you use bountysource or contribute via paypal (to stephen@liberty-irm.com) to open up bounties on issues, it is very, very likely that I will add features and fix issues sooner than later. 

Otherwise, if you have the ability to contribute yourself, please just do so as normal - I'll review and pull changes as they come in as quickly as I can.
